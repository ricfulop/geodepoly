# Six Ways AI Can Leverage GeodePoly

This guide explains **six practical ways** to use GeodePoly in AI systems, with short examples and rationale.

---

## 1) Differentiable Root Layer (inside neural nets)

**What:** A custom autograd op that maps polynomial **coefficients → roots**.  
**Why:** Many objectives live in root space (stability, damping, spectral radius). Gradients are analytic for simple roots:
\[
\frac{\partial r_i}{\partial a_k} = -\frac{r_i^k}{p'(r_i)}.
\]

**PyTorch sketch**
```python
from geodepoly.ai.rootlayer_torch import root_solve_torch
coeffs = torch.randn(B, N+1, dtype=torch.cdouble, requires_grad=True)
roots  = root_solve_torch(coeffs)          # [B, N]
loss   = (roots.real.clamp(min=0)**2).mean()  # penalize right-half-plane
loss.backward()
```

**Tips:**  
- Mask/damp gradients if \(|p'(r)|\) is tiny (near multiplicity).  
- Keep a Halley “polish” step in forward for accuracy.

## 2) GeodeBench: symmetry‑generalization tasks

**What:** A dataset built from Geode/Hyper‑Catalan arrays.  
**Tasks:** (a) Coefficient prediction under masked Geode layers; (b) Recover the Geode factor \(G\) from \(S\); (c) Invariance under shift/scale.  
**Why:** Tests whether models learn **mechanistic symmetry** rather than memorizing sequences.

**Deliverables:** CSV/NPZ splits, baseline Transformer, metrics (exact‑match, symmetric‑MAE, invariance accuracy, OOD gap).

---

## 3) Inductive‑bias layers that “speak polynomial”

**What:** New architectural blocks aligned with Geode structure.  
- **Geode Convolution:** dynamic‑programming accumulation over face layers (the same loops used in series evaluation).  
- **Power‑basis attention:** expose \([1,x,x^2,\dots]\) or orthogonal bases as keys/values to ease algebraic transforms.  
- **Root‑space heads:** consume roots/pseudo‑spectra directly (from RootLayer).

**Why:** Aligning model structure with polynomial/combinatorial structure improves data efficiency and generalization.

---

## 4) Training objectives in root space

**What:** Losses that act on roots, not coefficients.  
- **Pole placement:** push real parts left of a margin.  
- **Spectral radius:** penalize \(\max_i |r_i|\).  
- **Root‑set matching:** compare sets (sorted or via Hungarian matching).

**Why:** Many control and physics constraints are linear in root space but non‑linear in coefficient space.

**Example**
```python
from geodepoly.ai.losses import pole_placement_loss
roots = root_solve_torch(coeffs)     # [B, N]
loss  = pole_placement_loss(roots, half_plane="left", margin=0.1)
loss.backward()
```

## 5) Neuro‑symbolic loops & program synthesis

**What:** Let LLMs or search procedures **call the solver** for fast examples/counterexamples, invariance checks, or candidate verification.  
**Why:** Tightens the feedback loop for symbolic regression, theorem hints, and safety checks (e.g., Routh–Hurwitz style constraints).

**Pattern:** generate → verify with GeodePoly → refine → repeat.  
**Add‑on:** enforce Viète identities as a regularizer during search.

---

## 6) GPU/Compiler target (batched kernels)

**What:** Compile Geode’s face‑layer accumulation into **batched GPU kernels** (JAX/XLA, CUDA), and expose a **differentiable RootLayer** over large batches.  
**Why:** Needed for large‑scale training (graphics filters, control, audio, AR).  
**Path:** start with JAX `vmap`/`scan`, then specialized tiling kernels.

---

## Quick 30‑day plan

1. Ship **RootLayer** (Torch & JAX) with analytic backward; add grad tests.  
2. Release **losses** (`pole_placement_loss`, `spectral_radius_loss`, `root_set_loss`) + two runnable examples.  
3. Publish **GeodeBench v0** (3 tasks + baseline).  
4. Draft **Geode Convolution** spec and a JAX prototype.
