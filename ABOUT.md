# About geodepoly

geodepoly is a Python package for robust polynomial root-finding that blends analytic series reversion (Lagrange inversion / hyper-Catalan series) with reliable classical finishers.

## Highlights
- Series-reversion seeds with optional resummation (Padé, Borel, Borel–Padé, auto)
- Simultaneous Aberth–Ehrlich iteration with adaptive damping and clustering safeguards
- Multiplicity-aware Halley polishing
- Bridges: SymPy helper and JSON CLI for Mathematica/Maple
